# k2db

My solutions to the projects set in [CMU's Intro to Database Systems Course](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLSE8ODhjZXjbohkNBWQs_otTrBTrjyohi) in Rust

The intention of this repo is for me to learn about database internals and DBMS development by following that CMU course, and to brush up on Rust.

## Progress

- [Project 1](https://15445.courses.cs.cmu.edu/fall2019/project1/)
  - [Task 1](src/dbms/buffer/replacer/clock_replacer.rs)
  - [Task 2 (WIP)](src/dbms/buffer/pool_manager/pool_manager.rs)
